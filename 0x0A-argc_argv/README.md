This is a simple C program that prints the name of the program to the standard output. Let's go through the code step by step:
#include < stdio.h > 
#include "main.h"
This code includes the standard input/output library and a custom header file main.h. The custom header file may contain function declarations or other preprocessor directives.
/** 
* main - prints the name of the program 
* @argc: number of arguments 
* @argv: array of arguments 
* 
* Return: Always 0 (Success) 
*/
This code defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. The function takes two arguments: argc, an integer representing the number of arguments passed to the program, and argv, an array of strings containing the arguments passed to the program. The function returns an integer value (in this case, 0) to the operating system indicating whether the program terminated successfully or not.
int main(int argc __attribute__((unused)), char *argv[])
The __attribute__((unused)) is a GCC attribute that suppresses the "unused parameter" warning when compiling with -Wunused-parameter flag. In this case, argc is not used in the function body, so this attribute is used to prevent the warning
